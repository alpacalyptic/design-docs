How to survive the Alpacalypse
==============================

It is 3057. Alpacas have taken over the world, but they kept the humans as personal slaves... and personal snacks. They have kidnapped their allies the llamas by taking them by surprise. YOU must free the llamas and gain their trust. YOU must overthrow the alpacas and free all of the humans. The alpacas planned their attack well. Chuck Norris has moved to another dimension, sadly, and won't be of any help.
This is a first person shooter, with everything from futuristic vehicles and weapons, to really, really old memes, like Nyan Cat and the marvelous Breadfish.
The object of the game is to overthrow the usurper alpacas and free all of humanity. The mix of seriousness and laughs makes this game a really enjoyable experience.
Some achievements do exist, like "Alpaca Hunter, Weapons Specialist, Violence Is ALWAYS The Answer, and Overkill"
You are Henry (Default name, can be changed) and you are the only one who knew that the Alpacalypse was going to happen. so you built a bunker and survived the initial attack. The alpacas don't know that you survived, and you built a training course into it. Before you can get out the first time, you need to do a training coarse with easier alpaca enemys. The bunker has basic weapons, and tons of ammo. There is also an easter egg if you can find it.
Carl the llama will evnetually help you in your quest to defeat the alpacas, but keep him fed, or he'll kill you. He eats hands.
